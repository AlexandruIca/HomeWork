\subsection{Detailed Description}
Every object that has information about a primitive is derived from \mbox{\hyperlink{classdummy__api_1_1Shape}{Shape}}.

Cannot be instantiated(only through derived ojects). Instead of calling functions like \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacedummy__api_a249a7c0ef8dbebf1440e41f7a5c0298f}{point}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacedummy__api_a7bac2a56021c552911f6dc5ae4c8f5ad}{line}} you can create objects that store information needed to draw the primitives so you can modify it later. Objects have the Upper\+Camel\+Case naming convention(eg. \mbox{\hyperlink{classdummy__api_1_1Line}{Line}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classdummy__api_1_1Point}{Point}}). Constructors of derived objects should have the same parameters as their functions relatives. Each derived class will provide equality operators and comparison operators for the same types. Each derived class will provide methods for retrieving information like color and position. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
